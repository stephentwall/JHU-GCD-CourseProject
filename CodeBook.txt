Code Book for "Getting and Cleaning Data" GCD course project

Study Design:

The resultant tidy data were derived from the UC Irvine 
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" (UCI HAR data) found here: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

30 subjects performed 6 activities and smartphone sensor data was gathered.

Tidy Data set:

The Test and training data were aggregated into one large table per the features.txt columns 
found in the UCI HAR data.

The run_analysis.R script then removes all sensor data columns except for any columns related to the
standard deviation and mean.  See tidyColumns.txt for column headings.  The values in the table are 
the averages of a specific measure for each subject performing an activity.

THe tidy data shows 180 observations of 81 variables, See tidyColumns.txt for variable names.
